# DH-140

This page documents some of the preliminary ideas and background research conducted for my DH 140 Final Project. 

### Data and Vizualization of Interest

Journal: 
[The Predictive Dynamics of Happiness & Well-Being](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17540739211063851)

I have always been fascinated with positive psychology, happiness, and well-being, as well as the factors that affect it. In this journal, the authors dive into how data science can be used to predict happiness. 

Data Visualization:

The datapoints are really clear and provide an engaging highlight of countries with the highest and lowest happiness rating in each continent. 

### Ideas for data to investigate
1. 
- The relationship between religion and happiness.
- The impact of COVID-19 on mental health.

2. "Seven ways humanists are using computers to understand text." particularly interests me, especially with the recent ChatGPT craze, as it could potentially revolutionize the way humans can interact with computers and AI.


3.
